\begin{abstract}
Object-centric interactions provide rich learning moments for young
children, including opportunities to discover word meanings. Children's
first-person object handling experience, in particular, forms a key
source of input---one that varies across cultures and across
development. Using daylong photo streams from child-worn cameras, we
analyze \textgreater16k images to identify the frequency and targets of
child object handling across the first four years in two small-scale
subsistence farming communities on opposite sides of the globe (Papuan
and Mayan). Overall, we see a general consistency in the broad
composition of handled objects across cultures and age, likely
reflecting stable properties of children's physical environments and
day-to-day routines. However, the exact objects available to children
vary both within and across communities and also diversify with age.
These various distributions of handling patterns are discussed in their
relation to potential consequences for word learning.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The objects that we regularly pick up and handle---a coffee cup, a
laptop, a baby bottle---offer a window into the physical, social, and
cultural contexts that shape our understanding of the world. In this
paper, we take a glimpse into everyday life at its beginnings by
exploring children's at-home object handling from early infancy until
age four.

\hypertarget{object-handling-and-word-learning}{%
\subsection{Object handling and word
learning}\label{object-handling-and-word-learning}}

We contextualize our study with respect to the effects of object-centric
interaction on word learning. For young children, objects---along with
their associated activities and surrounding language---form a critical
source of input. Caregivers' tendency to use nouns referring to objects
in the here-and-now positively predicts children's early word
comprehension (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017; see also Slone, Smith, \& Yu,
2019) by helping learners map word forms onto their meanings in and
across real-time interaction (e.g., Yu \& Smith, 2013; Yurovsky, Smith,
\& Yu, 2013). Children also actively shape their own input via the
objects that they choose to pick up and handle. Children's own object
handling influences not only which objects dominate their visual fields
(Suanda et al., 2019) but sometimes also the language that they hear
about those objects (e.g., Chang, Barbaro, \& Deák, 2016).

How frequently do children engage in object-centric interactions? First,
hands---others' and their own---are in good supply in young children's
view of the world, especially after early infancy (Fausey, Jayaraman, \&
Smith, 2016; Jayaraman, Fausey, \& Smith, 2017; Long et al., 2020).
Infants' own object handling is relatively frequent: Herzberg and
colleagues (2022) find that US infants handle objects \({\sim}60\%\) of
the time during at-home play, Yu and colleagues (2013) find
\({\sim}70\%\) when including joint handling with adults in US in-lab
object play, and Casillas and Elliott (2021) find \({\sim}15\) and 17\%
object handling in daylong photo streams in a Papuan and a Mayan
community, respectively.

A first step in determining what children may be able to learn from
these frequent first-person holding experiences is to examine
\emph{what} objects are being held. From there, we can explore the
second critical ingredient for word learning---how often children are
also encountering linguistic information relating to handled objects
(e.g., their labels and associated concepts). This labeling piece may
only occur during a small subset of total object handling time. We do
not yet know how often objects in the here-and-now are typically talked
about over the course of children's whole waking days at home, but we do
know that such talk fluctuates across high and low activity periods
(Bergelson et al., 2019). We also know that children's object handling
varies enormously across the first few years due to cross-cultural
differences in available objects and caregiving practices, as well as
age-related maturational constraints.

\hypertarget{object-handling-across-cultures}{%
\subsection{Object handling across
cultures}\label{object-handling-across-cultures}}

The array of objects available to children varies in type and prevalence
across cultures. Objects that have spread via globalization (e.g.,
plastic bags) and objects with a basic functional role that has arisen
similarly across many groups (e.g., spoon-like tools for eating) are
likely to appear widely, while other objects remain specific to people
and places (e.g., the gourd and bombilla for drinking mate in much of
South America, stemming from Indigenous Guaraní and Tupí tradition).

Early access to objects is also shaped by culture-specific practices for
carrying children, keeping them safe and warm, and scaffolding their
development of locally-valued capacities (e.g., word learning in many US
families, walking in Kenyan Kipsigis families: Super, 1976; see Adolph,
Karasik, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2010, for an overview). Take, for example,
middle-class US family homes, which have been noted for their large
quantities of possessions, or ``clutter''---much of which designed
specifically for children (e.g., toys and picture books: Arnold et al.,
2012). We might infer, based on these assemblages of home objects, that
much of what children do and talk about at home is centered around what
particularly interests them. Recent work by Herzberg and colleagues
(2022) underscores this point with data from infants (13--23 months old)
who spent nearly 70\% of their time in object play with toys or a mix of
toys and non-toys, with \({\sim}100\%\) of infants playing with
children's books and stuffed animals, and a total of 32 toy types
appearing in \({\ge}25\%\) of infants' play. Non-toy play was also
common but still appeared to predominantly include infant-specific
objects (e.g., sippy cups, baby spoons, high chairs, pacifiers). We
would expect many of these items to be rare in other parts of the world,
with much greater overlap between objects for infants and objects for
adults (e.g., Karasik et al., 2018).

\hypertarget{object-handling-across-age}{%
\subsection{Object handling across
age}\label{object-handling-across-age}}

In early infancy, children have little ability to hold things or to
control their posture, so they primarily interact with the objects that
others bring near to them. Faces, rather than objects, may make up a
much greater proportion of their social and visual input early on
(Fausey, Jayaraman, \& Smith, 2016; Jayaraman, Fausey, \& Smith, 2017;
but see also Long et al., 2020). However, later gains in manual
dexterity and gross motor skill (e.g., sitting, crawling, walking)
increasingly widen children's ability to seek, reach, and grab a
diversity of objects in their environments. Increasing motor development
not only gives children greater control over what objects they handle,
but also how they elicit social and linguistic information relating to
objects and for how long (Adolph, Karasik, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2010;
Gaskins, 2000; Herzberg et al., 2022; Kretch, Franchak, \& Adolph, 2014;
Sanchez et al., 2018).

\hypertarget{the-current-study}{%
\subsection{The current study}\label{the-current-study}}

While prior work makes a strong case for the impact of children's
object-centric interactions on their word learning, the findings: (a)
are limited to a culturally narrow sample of populations, (b) have
tended to rely on short recordings that limit the scope of the
object-centered interactions analyzed, and (c) have rarely examined in
detail the distributions of individual objects that children typically
interact with at home (exceptions include Bergelson et al., 2019;
Casillas \& Elliott, 2021; Herzberg et al., 2022).

In the current work, we use daylong photo streams from child-worn
cameras to analyze object handling by children under age four in two
rural, small-scale subsistence farming communities on opposite sides of
the globe: Rossel Island (``Rossel''; Milne Bay Province, Papua New
Guinea) and Tenejapa (``Tseltal''; Chiapas, Mexico). While these
communities are comparable in many ways (e.g., rural, swidden
horticulturalist, housed in multi-generation family complexes), prior
work has established substantial differences in the organization of
young children's daily lives, child carrying practices, and each
community's level of market integration (i.e., greater availability of
synthetic materials in Tenejapa), leading us to expect differences in
the objects that children handle across the day and early lifespan
(Brown \& Casillas, 2021; Casillas, Brown, \& Levinson, 2020, 2021;
Casillas \& Elliott, 2021).

Using these manually annotated photo streams, we first establish how
often children handle objects from different categories (e.g., food
vs.~tools), both by the total amount of handling and by number of unique
objects per hour in each category across sites. We explore the top
individual objects in each site along with the overlap that exists
between communities. We then investigate how the rate and
characteristics of object handling change with age.

Our findings reveal relative consistency in the broad composition of
objects handled by children, both between sites and across age, with a
few important exceptions: a greater diversity of synthetic objects
handled by Tseltal children (e.g., relating to greater market
integration), more time spent with immovable objects for Rossel children
(e.g., relating to socializing time on/near household verandas), and a
greater diversity of held objects and greater number of transitions
between objects across age. While we focus here on describing the
distributional patterns of children's object handling, we do this with
an eye toward the cognitive and linguistic implications of these
experiences---namely, consequences for word learning.

\hypertarget{corpus}{%
\subsection{Corpus}\label{corpus}}

Daylong photo streams consisted of images captured approximately every
15 (Rossel) to 30 (Tseltal) seconds over the course of 8 (Rossel) to 9
(Tseltal) waking hours at home. Children wore a recording vest equipped
with a camera (Narrative Clip 1) and miniature fisheye lens (Photojojo
Super Fisheye) that provided a 180\(\text{\textdegree}\) view of the
environment. For younger infants who were not yet walking, the camera
was instead worn by the primary caregiver.

Previously, 83 daylong photo streams (113,668 photos) had been
comprehensively manually annotated for the presence or absence of child
object handling (Casillas \& Elliott, 2021). Here, we further annotate
and analyze the subset of 16,916 photos with confirmed child object
handling.

We included one randomly selected daylong photo stream from each of 77
children with object handling in the original data set (Rossel: 41,
Tseltal: 36). Children ranged in age from 0 to 48 months
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 21.9,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 22.7). The amount of object
handling and thus the number of photos available to be annotated varied
across children, ranging from 1 to 631
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 238.2,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 198.6).

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{manual-annotation}{%
\subsection{Manual annotation}\label{manual-annotation}}

Photos were annotated with IMCO, an open-source Python program adapted
for efficient coding of photo streams (Casey et al., 2022). Annotators
provided labels for the handled object(s) in each photo (e.g.,
``stick'') and selected among a set of predefined categories to
characterize each type of object (e.g., ``Natural''). Categories
included consumables (e.g., food, drinks, and drugs: ``Food''), mealtime
tools (``Tool-M''), toys, clothing, tools for working \emph{or} cleaning
(``Tool-W''), large or immovable objects (e.g., furniture and housing
structures), natural objects, and miscellaneous synthetic objects (see
Figure 1 for example images and Table 1 for example objects from each
category). In the reported findings, \textbf{object} refers to any
exemplar of a type of object (e.g., any stick), rather than a particular
instance of an object (e.g., a specific stick). \textbf{Object category}
refers to the predefined categories used to classify each object type
(e.g., ``Natural,'' ``Toy,'' ``Immovable'').

\hypertarget{data-preparation-and-reliability}{%
\subsection{Data preparation and
reliability}\label{data-preparation-and-reliability}}

Images were excluded if they were too dark, bright, blurry, or covered
for annotators to identify handled objects, if annotators were otherwise
unsure about what objects were being handled, if there was no handled
object, or if the researcher was still present when the image was
captured (\emph{n} = 1,138, or 6.7\% of the data set). To avoid
unnecessary data loss, all excluded photos were checked by at least one
other annotator and re-included for analysis if objects were
identifiable. In total, 15,778 images were deemed usable by annotators
(Rossel: 9,223, Tseltal: 6,555). One participant had no usable images,
so our analyses are based on 76 photo streams.

To confirm sufficient reliability, 20\% of photo streams were double
coded. Reliability annotations were equally spread across sites and ages
and included a total of 8,288 images. At the category level, annotators
agreed on 91.2\% of decisions, on average across photo streams (Rossel:
91.9\%, Tseltal: 90.6\%). At the object label level, annotators agreed
on 85.1\% of decisions (Rossel: 86.1\%, Tseltal: 84.3\%).

Children handled an average of 26.7 unique objects per day (median =
27.0, \emph{SD} = 16.0, range = 1--58), with no significant differences
across sites (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 26.3,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 27.2, \emph{W} = 700.50,
\emph{p} = 0.863). The distribution of handled objects was highly
right-skewed within and across children. Each child's distribution was
skewed such that a small group of objects was handled in a majority of
their images, but most objects were handled for only short periods of
time (Figure 2). Across children, common objects followed a similar
Zipfian distribution: some objects were handled by many children, but
most objects were only handled by 1--2 children in each site (Rossel:
55.7\%, Tseltal: 60.9\%).

Comparing across sites, 34.8\% of objects were handled by both Rossel
and Tseltal children, and several shared objects were among the most
frequently handled in both sites. In fact, among the top 25 most common
objects\footnote{The study camera was the object that was handled by the
  most children in both sites (Rossel: 68.3\%, Tseltal: 91.4\% of
  children; see Bergelson et al., 2019, for a similar effect) but
  accounted for a relatively small percentage of each child's object
  handling time, on average (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} =
  3.6\%, \emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 6.5\% of images).
  Inclusion of study-related items did not qualitatively change any of
  the reported results, unless otherwise noted.}, 10 were shared across
sites (Figure 3).

\hypertarget{effects-of-object-category}{%
\subsection{Effects of object
category}\label{effects-of-object-category}}

We quantified the distribution of object categories at two timescales:
across the whole waking day (i.e., overall \% handling for different
object categories across all images) and across individual hours (i.e.,
number of unique objects from different object categories per hour).

During any given hour, children handled 5.3 objects from 3.0 different
categories, on average (median = 4.0 objects, \emph{SD} = 4.9, range =
0--27). We exclude from the following analyses, any hour in which a
child did not handle any objects; inclusion of these hours creates a
second mode at 0, violating our statistical models' assumptions of
normality.

To test for differences across sites and categories, we ran individual
linear mixed-effects regressions for each of the eight object
categories, with category membership dummy coded (i.e., objects
belonging to the target category for a given model = 1, objects
belonging to other categories = 0). Each regression model included fixed
effects of site, category, and a site-by-category interaction as well as
random intercepts for individual children\footnote{lmer(unique objects
  per hour \({\sim}\) category (target/non-target; factorial) * site
  (Rossel/Tseltal; factorial) + (1 \textbar{} child))}. After correcting
for multiple comparisons, we found a significant main effect of the
synthetic object category (\(\beta\) = 0.35, \emph{SE} = 0.09, \emph{t}
= 4.04, \emph{p} = 0.001) and a marginal site-by-synthetic interaction
(\(\beta\) = 0.36, \emph{SE} = 0.12, \emph{t} = 2.93, \emph{p} = 0.058)
such that children handled more unique synthetic objects per hour than
objects from other categories, and this effect was stronger for Tseltal
children than for Rossel children. Additionally, we found negative main
effects for the toy (\(\beta\) = -0.42, \emph{SE} = 0.13, \emph{t} =
-3.14, \emph{p} = 0.034), mealtime tool (\(\beta\) = -0.35, \emph{SE} =
0.12, \emph{t} = -2.96, \emph{p} = 0.056), clothing (\(\beta\) = -0.32,
\emph{SE} = 0.11, \emph{t} = -3.02, \emph{p} = 0.049), and work tool
(\(\beta\) = -0.65, \emph{SE} = 0.17, \emph{t} = -3.86, \emph{p} =
0.002) categories, indicating that children handled fewer unique objects
from these categories per hour relative to other categories. Finally, a
significant main effect of the immovable object category (\(\beta\) =
0.43, \emph{SE} = 0.11, \emph{t} = 3.95, \emph{p} = 0.002) and a
significant site-by-immovable interaction (\(\beta\) = -0.76, \emph{SE}
= 0.17, \emph{t} = -4.44, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001) revealed that
children handled more unique immovable objects per hour than objects
from other categories, and this effect was stronger for Rossel children
than for Tseltal children (Figure 4).

\hypertarget{effects-of-age}{%
\subsection{Effects of age}\label{effects-of-age}}

Prior work with this same corpus indicated a significant increase in
object handling across the first four years (Casillas \& Elliott, 2021).
By adding information about \emph{what} objects children are handling,
we can now explore finer-grained characteristics of age-related change
in object handling behaviors. We investigate changes in (a) the
distribution of object categories, (b) the number of unique objects and
categories handled per hour, and (c) transitions between objects and
categories per hour.

\hypertarget{do-children-handle-different-types-of-objects-with-age}{%
\subsubsection{Do children handle different types of objects with
age?}\label{do-children-handle-different-types-of-objects-with-age}}

We fit individual linear regressions predicting the proportion of
handling time for each category as a function of age (in months), site,
and their interaction. We included number of images as an additional
fixed effect to account for the wide range in total available images for
each child (range = 1--631) and the resulting greater likelihood of
detecting proportions near 0 or 1 when there were only a handful of
images\footnote{As expected, number of handling images was correlated
  with age (\emph{r} = 0.50 {[}0.31, 0.65{]}, \emph{p} \textless{}
  0.001), which we attribute to changes in motor development and
  permitted object access over the first four years (Casillas \&
  Elliott, 2021). That is, the correlation is an artifactual outcome of
  development. Including both variables as fixed effects in a regression
  poses no technical issue in estimating \(R^{2}\), but does limit the
  total variance attributed independently to either variable (Wurm \&
  Fisicaro, 2014). Thus, for models of non-proportional measures, we
  rely solely on age to capture this variance (i.e.,
  lmer(non-proportional DV \({\sim}\) age (months; numeric) * site
  (Rossel/Tseltal; factorial) + (1 \textbar{} child)).}. This analysis
revealed no significant age-related changes in the frequency of handling
of different object categories\footnote{The only exception was an
  initial finding of a decrease in handling of clothing over age
  (\(\beta\) \textless{} 0.001, \emph{SE} = 0.001, \emph{t} = -2.88,
  \emph{p} = 0.005). However, after removing study-related clothing
  (i.e., the vest containing the camera), this effect was no longer
  significant.} and no significant site-by-age interaction effects (all
adjusted \emph{p}s \textgreater{} 0.05). Thus, the the broad composition
of handled objects remained largely stable over age. \newline

\hypertarget{does-object-handling-diversify-with-age}{%
\subsubsection{Does object handling diversify with
age?}\label{does-object-handling-diversify-with-age}}

In addition to the overall age-related increase in handling found by
Casillas and Elliott (2021), we see that, with increasing age, children
handled more unique objects per hour (\(\beta\) = 0.12, \emph{SE} =
0.03, \emph{t} = 3.60, \emph{p} = 0.001; Figure 5A) and more objects
from different categories per hour (\(\beta\) = 0.06, \emph{SE} = 0.01,
\emph{t} = 4.45, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001; Figure 5B). These effects
were consistent across sites; we found no main effects of site or
interactions between site and age (all \emph{p}s \textgreater{}
0.05).\newline

\hypertarget{does-object-handling-become-more-complex-with-age}{%
\subsubsection{Does object handling become more complex with

Analysis of children's relative rate of transition between objects per
hour (i.e., the number of transitions from one object to another divided
by the number of available objects for that hour) did not reveal an
overall age-related increase (\(\beta\) = 0.01, \emph{SE} = 0.003,
\emph{t} = 1.59, \emph{p} = 0.116). However, there was a significant
main effect of site (\(\beta\) = -0.30, \emph{SE} = 0.13, \emph{t} =
-2.37, \emph{p} = 0.020; Figure 6C), indicating that Tseltal children
made fewer transitions between objects per hour than Rossel children.
While the site-by-age interaction term did not reach statistical
significance (\(\beta\) = 0.01, \emph{SE} = 0.005, \emph{t} = 1.54,
\emph{p} = 0.128), descriptively, this difference appears to be more
pronounced for younger children. At the category level, we found that
children made marginally more transitions between object categories per
hour with age (\(\beta\) = 0.01, \emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = 1.69,
\emph{p} = 0.095), in addition to a marginal main effect of site
(\(\beta\) = -0.53, \emph{SE} = 0.31, \emph{t} = -1.70, \emph{p} =
0.092; Figure 6D) that mirrors the finding for object transitions:
Tseltal children made fewer category transitions per hour than Rossel
children.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In the current descriptive work, we annotated and analyzed 16,916 images
featuring at-home child object handling from children under age four in
two subsistence communities from opposite sides of the globe. Our main
findings are as follows: Children's overall handling of different object
categories (e.g., food vs.~toys vs.~natural objects) appears stable
across age and cultural context. In contrast, when it comes to the
number of unique objects per hour, children handled a greater diversity
of synthetic and immovable objects, relative to the other categories,
and did so to different extents across sites. The rate of transition
between objects also varied between sites. Finally, time spent with
objects is Zipfian-distributed, and many of the most common objects
within sites were also common across sites. We discuss this rich set of
findings with respect to (a) object handling as a window into children's
worlds in general, and (b) the implications of object handling patterns
for word learning.

\hypertarget{objects-as-insight-into-childrens-worlds}{%
\subsection{Objects as insight into children's
worlds}\label{objects-as-insight-into-childrens-worlds}}

Our findings, while preliminary, suggest that different measures of
object handling reveal unique aspects of children's worlds. The total
time children spend handling objects of different types (e.g., natural,
immovable, synthetic, etc.) appears stable across age and sites
(consistent with Long et al., 2021, for visually present categories).
Specifically, food and synthetic objects are most prevalent. We suggest
that this measure of \textbf{total time spent within categories} may
reflect stable properties of children's physical environments and their
routine activities, across age and across diverse contexts. If we were
to sample in other communities, we would expect to find more differences
(e.g., more time spent with toys in US middle-class samples: Herzberg et
al., 2022), but these two rural subsistence communities show overall
similar profiles despite substantial differences in their current level
of market integration, organization of daily life, infant carrying
practices, and other aspects of their cultural milieux (Brown \&
Casillas, 2021; Casillas, Brown, \& Levinson, 2020, 2021; Casillas \&
Elliott, 2021).

In contrast, the \textbf{number of individual objects} children handle
reveals strong age-related change, as well as some differences between
sites. Children's object handling diversifies within and across
categories as they get older, which means more unique objects handled
from more categories. We see that Rossel children transition between
objects more frequently than Tseltal children. This difference can
likely be attributed to culture-specific child carrying
practices---Tseltal children are often carried in a sling during their
early years and are therefore less freely able to seek out and handle
new objects (Casillas \& Elliott, 2021). Compared to other categories,
children handle a greater diversity of synthetic objects (stronger for
Tseltal) and immovable objects (stronger for Rossel) per hour. These
cross-site differences reflect the greater market integration (and hence
availability of diverse synthetic objects) in the Tseltal community and
the long daily periods of socializing around and climbing on family
verandas in the Rossel community.

We suggest that the individual objects that children handle give us
insight into development. Through identification of the specific objects
that children engage with, we can detect age-related changes, both in
object access and in the dynamics of object-centric interaction (e.g.,
rate of transition between objects). Moreover, knowing what objects
children handle can reveal many facets of everyday life that vary across
economic and cultural contexts (e.g., whether a variety of toys is
available for purchase nearby, or whether daily socializing takes place
on climbable surfaces).

\hypertarget{implications-for-word-learning}{%
\subsection{Implications for word
learning}\label{implications-for-word-learning}}

Our data indicate that children are exposed to a stable and wide variety
of object categories in the first four years of life. Children also have
increasing access to a diversity of objects within categories as they
get older. Similarity in the distribution of categories across sites
suggests some basis for expecting similarity in early object label
knowledge and other associated word knowledge by children in these two
sites. Individual objects also show a Zipfian distribution in how they
are handled, with some handled frequently and most handled infrequently.
This distribution may help support children's word learning (see
Carvalho, Chen, \& Yu, 2019; Clerkin et al., 2017; Long et al., 2021;
Montag, Jones, \& Smith, 2018), and in tandem with other observed
effects across age and cultural context, may indicate which words (i.e.,
object names or other object-relevant words) children are likely to
learn first and how their semantic networks grow within and across
categories.

\hypertarget{future-directions}{%
\subsection{Future directions}\label{future-directions}}

Here, we grouped objects on the basis of broad semantic categories.
While this categorization allows us to describe the overall distribution
of handling across different types of objects, it does not necessarily
give us insight into the specific associated activities or applied
functions of objects. Knowing more about \emph{how} objects are being
used in context could help (a) further indicate links between social and
linguistic behavior, and (b) reveal more changes over developmental time
(e.g., a spoon as a teething toy, musical instrument, and ultimately, a
utensil).

To more directly compare to existing data from other cultural contexts,
we will need to further analyze the temporal characteristics of handling
bouts and track unique object tokens rather than just types (Herzberg et
al., 2022). We note, however, that this second task will be
near-impossible for some object types in the Rossel and Tseltal context
(e.g., leaves, twigs). As of now, we find less within-site overlap in
the exact objects handled by Rossel and Tseltal children compared to
Herzberg et al. (2022)'s US data, but this could be as much due to
recording type (e.g., two-hour videos vs.~daylong photos) as to cultural
difference. Thus, future cross-community investigations with
parallel---ideally daylong---recording methods are needed to more fully
understand the influence of culture on children's typical object
handling experience.

Relating to direct implications for word learning, our most urgent goal
is to analyze the speech surrounding bouts of object handling to derive
estimates of (a) how often objects are talked about, (b) what type of
information is mentioned, and (c) by whom. By combining our existing
annotations of daylong photo streams with time-linked daylong audio data
in two unrelated cultural contexts, our aim is to develop a benchmark
against which models and mechanisms of word learning via object-centric
interaction can be tested.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Analyzing the types of objects that children handle gives us a window
into what they are interested in, what they do and talk about with
others, what they are allowed to access, and more. Handled objects offer
learners a range of sensory experiences that could be paired with the
social, linguistic, and physical information around them. In the present
study, we examined coarse patterns in young children's at-home object
handling in two unrelated subsistence communities, finding many striking
similarities despite differences in the communities' market integration
and ways of life. Our data provide some basis for kernels of similarity
in experience across culture and change with developmental time.
However, our findings also point to immense variation in the assemblages
of unique objects handled by individual children and indicate that
children actually spend only narrow slices of time with a vast majority
of objects. Determining if and how these distributional patterns, plus
language input, coalesce to give rise to word learning is a crucial next
step.
