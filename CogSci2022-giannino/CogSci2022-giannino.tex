\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The objects that we regularly pick up and handle---a coffee cup, a
laptop, a baby bottle---offer a window into the physical, social, and
cultural contexts that shape our understanding of the world. In this
paper, we take a glimpse into everyday life at its beginnings by
exploring children's at-home object handling from early infancy until
age four. We contextualize our study with respect to the effects of
object-centric interaction on word learning, though we note that
different analyses of these same data could shed new light on other
types of social learning, in addition to motor development (see
Herzberg, Fletcher, Schatz, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2021, on the latter
point).

\hypertarget{object-handling-and-word-learning}{%
\subsection{Object handling and word
learning}\label{object-handling-and-word-learning}}

For young learners, objects---along with their associated activities and
surrounding language---form a critical source of input for word
learning. Hands (and what they are handling) can be reliable indicators
of what someone is attending to and talking about during object play and
can thus help learners map word forms onto their meanings in and across
real-time interaction (e.g., Yu \& Smith, 2013; Yurovsky, Smith, \& Yu,
2013). The labels of present, attended-to objects are reflected in the
babble of children who have acquired stable consonants (Laing \&
Bergelson, 2020). Further, caregivers' tendency to use nouns referring
to objects in the here-and-now positively predicts their children's
early word comprehension (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017; see also Slone,
Smith, \& Yu, 2019).

How frequently do children engage in object-centric interactions? First,
hands---others' and their own---are in good supply in young children's
view of the world, especially after early infancy (Fausey, Jayaraman, \&
Smith, 2016; Jayaraman, Fausey, \& Smith, 2017; Long, Kachergis,
Agrawal, \& Frank, 2020). Infants' own object handling is relatively
frequent: Herzberg and colleagues (2021) find that US infants handle
objects \({\sim}60\%\) of the time during at-home play, Yu and
colleagues (2013) find \({\sim}70\%\) when including joint handling with
adults in US in-lab object play, and Casillas and Elliott (2021) find
\({\sim}15\) and 17\% object handling in daylong photo streams in a
Papuan and a Mayan community, respectively. Concurrent with these
events, children will sometimes encounter linguistic information
relating to the focused-on object (e.g., its label and associated
concepts). However, this critical additional ingredient for word
learning may only occur during a small subset of total object handling
time. We do not yet know how often objects in the here and now are
typically talked about over the course of children's whole waking days
at home, but we do know that such talk fluctuates across high and low
activity periods (Bergelson, Amatuni, Dailey, Koorathota, \& Tor, 2019).
We also know that children's object handling input changes enormously
across the first few years due to both maturational constraints and
culture-specific caregiving practices.

\hypertarget{object-handling-across-cultures}{%
\subsection{Object handling across
cultures}\label{object-handling-across-cultures}}

The array of objects available to children varies in type and prevalence
across cultures. Objects spread via globalization (e.g., plastic bags)
and objects with a basic functional role that has arisen similarly
across many groups (e.g., spoon-like tools for eating) are likely to
appear widely, while other objects remain specific to people and places
(e.g., the gourd and bombilla for drinking mate in much of South
America, stemming from Indigenous Guaraní and Tupí tradition). Early
access to objects is also shaped by culture-specific practices for
carrying children, keeping them safe and warm, and scaffolding the
development of locally-valued capacities (e.g., word learning in many US
families, walking in Kenyan Kipsigis families: Super, 1976; see Adolph,
Karasik, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2010, for an overview). Take, for example,
middle-class US family homes, which have been noted for their large
quantities of possessions (``clutter''), much of which is designed
specifically for children (e.g., toys and books: Arnold, Graesch, Ochs,
\& Ragazzini, 2012). We might infer, based on these assemblages of home
objects, that much of what children do and talk about at home is
centered around what particularly interests them. Recent work by
Herzberg and colleagues (2021) underscores this point with data from
infants (13--23 months old) who spent nearly 70\% of their time in
object play with toys or a mix of toys and non-toys, with
\({\sim}100\%\) of infants playing with children's books and stuffed
animals, and a total of 32 toy types appearing in \({\ge}25\%\) of
infants' play. Non-toy play was also common but still appeared to
predominantly include infant-specific objects (e.g., sippy cups, baby
spoons, high chairs, pacifiers). We would expect many of these items to
be rare in other parts of the world, with much greater overlap between
objects for infants and objects for adults (e.g., Karasik, Schneider,
Kuchirko, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2018).

\hypertarget{object-handling-across-age}{%
\subsection{Object handling across
age}\label{object-handling-across-age}}

In early infancy, children have little ability to hold things or to
control their posture, primarily experiencing objects through what
others bring near to them. Faces, rather than objects, may make up a
much greater proportion of their social and visual input early on
(Fausey, Jayaraman, \& Smith, 2016; Jayaraman, Fausey, \& Smith, 2017;
but see also Long, Kachergis, Agrawal, \& Frank, 2020). However, later
gains in manual dexterity and gross motor skill (e.g., sitting,
crawling, walking) increasingly widen children's ability to seek, reach,
and grab a diversity of objects in their environments. Increasing motor
development not only gives children greater control over what objects
they handle, but also \emph{how} they elicit social information relating
to objects and for how long (Adolph, Karasik, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2010;
Gaskins, 2000; Herzberg, Fletcher, Schatz, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2021;
Kretch, Franchak, \& Adolph, 2014; Sanchez, Long, Kraus, \& Frank,
2018).

\hypertarget{the-current-study}{%
\subsection{The current study}\label{the-current-study}}

Using daylong photo streams from child-worn cameras, we analyze object
handling by children under age four in two rural, small-scale
subsistence farming communities from opposite sides of the globe: Rossel
Island (``Rossel''; Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea) and Tenejapa
(``Tseltal''; Chiapas, Mexico). While these communities are comparable
in many ways (e.g., rural, swidden horticulturalist, housed in
multi-generation family complexes), prior work has established
substantial differences in the organization of young children's daily
lives, child carrying practices, and each community's level of market
integration (i.e., greater availability of synthetic materials in
Tenejapa), leading us to expect differences in the objects that children
handle across the day and early lifespan (Brown \& Casillas, 2021;
Casillas, Brown, \& Levinson, 2020, 2021; Casillas \& Elliott, 2021). We
first establish how often children handle objects from different
categories (e.g., food vs.~tools), both by the total amount of handling
and by number of unique objects per hour in each category across sites.
We explore the top individual objects in each site along with the
overlap that exists between sites. Finally, we investigate how the rate
and characteristics of object handling change with age.

Our findings reveal relative consistency in the broad composition of
objects handled by children, both between sites and across age, with a
few important exceptions: a greater diversity of synthetic objects for
Tseltal children (e.g., relating to greater market integration), more
time spent with immovable objects for Rossel children (e.g., relating to
socializing time on/near household verandas), and a greater diversity of
held objects with developmental age. We discuss open questions and
potential implications of these findings for early word learning.

\section{Method}\label{method}}

\hypertarget{corpus}{%
\subsection{Corpus}\label{corpus}}

Daylong photo streams consisted of images captured approximately every
15 (Rossel) to 30 (Tseltal) seconds over the course of 8 (Rossel) to 9
(Tseltal) waking hours at home. Children wore a recording vest equipped
with a camera (Narrative Clip 1) and miniature fisheye lens (Photojojo
Super Fisheye) that provided a 180\(\text{\textdegree}\) view of the
environment. For younger infants who were not yet walking, the camera
was instead worn by the primary caregiver. Previously, 83 daylong photo
streams (113668 photos) had been comprehensively manually annotated for
the presence or absence of child object handling (Casillas \& Elliott,
2021). Here, we further annotate and analyze the subset of 16368 with
object handling in the present study.

We included one daylong photo stream from each of 74 children (Rossel:
39, Tseltal: 35), ranging in age from 0 to 48 months
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 22.2,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 23.3). The amount of object
handling and thus the number of photos annotated varied across children,
ranging from 1 to 584 (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 223.5,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 187.8).

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{manual-annotation}{%
\subsection{Manual annotation}\label{manual-annotation}}

Photos were annotated with IMCO, an open-source Python program adapted
for efficient coding of photo streams (Casey, Fisher, Tice, \& Casillas,
2022). Annotators provided labels for the handled object(s) in each
photo (e.g., ``twig'') and selected among predefined categories to
characterize each type of object (e.g., ``Natural''). Categories
included food, mealtime tools (``Tool-M''), toys, clothing, tools for
working or cleaning (``Tool-W''), immovable objects (e.g., furniture and
housing structures), natural objects, and miscellaneous synthetic
objects (see Figure 1 for example images and Table 1 for example objects
from each category).

\hypertarget{data-preparation-and-reliability}{%
\subsection{Data preparation and
reliability}\label{data-preparation-and-reliability}}

Images were excluded if they were too dark, bright, blurry, or covered
for annotators to identify handled objects (747 images, 4.56\% of the
data set), if annotators were otherwise unsure about what objects were
being handled (133, or 0.81\%), if there was no handled object (210, or
1.28\%), or if the researcher was still present when the image was
captured (3, or 0.02\%). To avoid unnecessary data loss, all excluded
photos were checked by at least one other annotator and re-included for
analysis if objects were identifiable. In total, 15290 images were
deemed usable by annotators (8717 for Rossel, 6573 for Tseltal).

XX\% of photo streams were double coded. Reliability annotations were
equally spread across sites and ages and included a total of XXXX
images. At the category level, annotators agreed on XX.X\% of decisions
(Rossel: XX.X\%, Tseltal: XX.X\%). At the object label level, annotators
agreed on XX.X\% of decisions (Rossel: XX.X\%, Tseltal: XX.X\%).

Children handled an average of 26.66 unique objects per day (median =
27, \emph{SD} = 15.65, range = 1--58), with no significant differences
across sites (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 26.28,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 27.09, \emph{W} = 669.5,
\emph{p} = 0.892). The distribution of handled objects was highly
right-skewed within and across children. Each child's distribution was
skewed such that a small group of objects was handled in a majority of
their images but most objects were handled for only short periods of
time (Figure 2). Across children, common objects followed a similar
Zipfian distribution: some objects were handled by many children, but
most objects were only handled by 1-2 children in each site (Rossel:
55.87\%, Tseltal: 61\%).

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Comparing across sites, 33.62\% of objects were present in both
communities, and several shared objects were among the most frequently
handled by children in both sites. In fact, among the top 25 most common
objects, 10 were shared across sites (Figure 3). Of note, the study
camera was the object that was handled by the most children in both
sites (Rossel: 69.2\%, Tseltal: 91.4\% of children) but accounted for a
relatively small percentage of each child's object handling time, on
average (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 3.8\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 6.5\% of images). The camera
and other study-related objects (i.e., vest and privacy cover for the
camera), were retained in our analyses; however, inclusion of these
items did not qualitatively change any of the reported results.

\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{effects-of-object-category}{%
\subsection{Effects of object
category}\label{effects-of-object-category}}

The overall frequency of object categories was similarly divided across
sites (Figure 4A). Children primarily handled food items
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 25.68\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 30.93\% of handling) and
miscellaneous synthetic objects (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} =
24.41\%, \emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 31.11\% of handling).
For 51 of 75 children, their top category was either food or synthetic
objects. Two-tailed Wilcoxon tests revealed three initially significant
category-level difference between sites: more handling of synthetic
objects by Tseltal children (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} =
24.41\%, \emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 31.11\%, \emph{p} =
0.032), and more handling of mealtime tools
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 10.36\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 8.1\%, \emph{p} = 0.044) and
immovable objects (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 7.53\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 2.52\%, \emph{p} = 0.035) by
Rossel children. However, after correcting for multiple comparisons,
these differences no longer reached statistical significance (all
adjusted \emph{p}s \textgreater{} 0.05).

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

During any given hour of the day that featured object handling, children
handled 6.50 objects from 3.69 different categories, on average (median
= 6.00 objects, \emph{SD} = 4.62, range = 1--27). To test for
differences across sites and categories, we ran individual linear
mixed-effects models for each of the eight object categories, with
category membership dummy coded (i.e., objects belonging to the target
category for a given model = 1, objects belonging to other categories =
0). Models included fixed effects of site, category, number of images,
and site-by-category interaction as well as random intercepts for
individual children. After correcting for multiple comparisons, we found
a significant main effect of the synthetic object category (\(\beta\) =
0.34, \emph{SE} = 0.09, \emph{t} = 3.86, \emph{p} = 0.003) and a
marginal site-by-synthetic interaction (\(\beta\) = 0.37, \emph{SE} =
0.12, \emph{t} = 2.99, \emph{p} = 0.054) such that children handled more
unique synthetic objects per hour than objects from other categories,
and this effect was stronger for Tseltal children than for Rossel
children. Additionally, we found negative main effects for the toy
(\(\beta\) = -0.41, \emph{SE} = 0.13, \emph{t} = -3.08, \emph{p} =
0.042) and work tool (\(\beta\) = -0.63, \emph{SE} = 0.17, \emph{t} =
-3.71, \emph{p} = 0.005) categories, indicating that children handled
fewer unique objects from these categories per hour. Finally, a
significant main effect of the immovable object category (\(\beta\) =
0.47, \emph{SE} = 0.11, \emph{t} = 4.24, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001) and
a significant site-by-immovable interaction (\(\beta\) = -0.84,
\emph{SE} = 0.17, \emph{t} = -4.85, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001) revealed
that children handled more unique immovable objects per hour than
objects from other categories, and this effect was stronger for Rossel
children than for Tseltal children (Figure 4B).

\hypertarget{effects-of-age}{%
\subsection{Effects of age}\label{effects-of-age}}

We tested for developmental changes in both the targets and rate of
object handling across the first four years.

First, we asked whether the distribution of object categories changes as
a function of age. We fit individual linear regression models predicting
the proportion of handling time for each of eight object categories as a
function of age (in months), site, and their interaction. We included
number of images as an additional fixed effect to account for the large
variation in total available images for each child (range = 1--584) and
thus the potential for finding many more proportion estimates close to 0
or 1 for children with fewer images, relative to children with hundreds
of images. This analysis revealed no significant age-related changes in
the frequency of handling of different object categories and no
significant site-by-age effects (all adjusted \emph{p}s \textgreater{}
0.05). Thus, the the broad composition of handled objects remained
largely stable over age (Figure 5).

It is important to note that age correlates closely with the number of
available images (STATS), as expected based on prior work with the same
data set showing that object handling increases significantly across age
(Casillas \& Elliott, 2021). While adding both age and number of images
as fixed effects did not introduce technical issues of collinearity
(STATS), the inclusion of these interrelated predictors necessarily
limits the total variance explained by our models of age-related change
(Wurm \& Fisicaro, 2014). Conceptually, we attribute the increase in
object handling across the sampled time frame to changes in motor
development and permitted object access over the first four years. For
the remaining analyses, which do not include proportional dependent
variables, we chose to include only fixed effects of age, rather than
also including what we assume to be its artifactual correlate: number of
images.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[!ht]

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

While prior work with this data set has established that overall object
handling time increases with age (Casillas \& Elliott, 2021), added
knowledge about the identities of handled objects in the current work
allows us to examine more fine-grained developmental changes in object
handling. Here, we modeled changes in the number of unique objects and
categories handled per hour as well as transitions between objects and
categories per hour. Models included fixed effects of age (in months)
and site, plus their interaction, along with random intercepts for
individual children.

With increasing age, children handled more unique objects per hour
(\(\beta\) = 0.11, \emph{SE} = 0.03, \emph{t} = 3.14, \emph{p} = 0.002;
Figure 6A) and more objects from different categories per hour
(\(\beta\) = 0.05, \emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = 4.02, \emph{p} = 0).
These effects were consistent across sites; we found no main effects of
site or interactions between site and age (all \emph{p}s \textgreater{}
0.05).

Analysis of children's relative rate of transition between objects per
hour (i.e., the number of object transitions divided by the number of
available objects for that hour) did not reveal an overall age-related
increase (\(\beta\) = 0.01, \emph{SE} = 0, \emph{t} = 1.59, \emph{p} =
0.117). However, there was a significant main effect of site (\(\beta\)
= -0.45, \emph{SE} = 0.14, \emph{t} = -3.21, \emph{p} = 0.002) as well
as a site-by-age interaction (\(\beta\) = 0.01, \emph{SE} = 0.01,
\emph{t} = 2.55, \emph{p} = 0.013), indicating that Tseltal children
made fewer transitions between objects per hour than Rossel children but
showed a steeper increase across age (Figure 6B). At the category level,
we found that, with increasing age, children made marginally more
transitions between object categories per hour (\(\beta\) = 0.02,
\emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = 1.94, \emph{p} = 0.056), with no detectable
differences across sites.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Just some miscellaneous notes for now

\hypertarget{cross-cultural-similarities-and-differences}{%
\subsection{Cross-cultural similarities and
differences}\label{cross-cultural-similarities-and-differences}}

Summary sentence of the broad overlap between communities on many of the
measures reported above, likely owing to the many characteristics that
are shared across these two cultural contexts (e.g., rural, swidden
horticulturalist, housed in multi-generation family complexes). However,
the differences that emerge between sites reveal the influence of market
integration, the organization of daily life, and infant carrying
practices (Brown \& Casillas, 2021; Casillas, Brown, \& Levinson, 2020,
2021; Casillas \& Elliott, 2021).

Marginally more unique synthetic objects for Tseltal children.
Discussion of the effects of market integration on the availability of
objects in Tenejapa vs.~Rossel Island.

More handling of large or immovable objects for Rossel kids. Discussion
of differences in the organization of young children's daily lives. More
time spent socializing on/near household verandas

Greater age-related increases in transitions between objects for Tseltal
children. Discussion of infant carrying practices. More time in sling
for Tseltal babies so fewer opportunities to seek out different objects
at the youngest ages.

\hypertarget{other-sources-of-consitency-and-variability}{%
\subsection{Other sources of consitency and
variability}\label{other-sources-of-consitency-and-variability}}

Possible changes with time of day and activity context as predicted in
prior work (e.g., morning mealtimes, Casillas, Brown, \& Levinson, 2020,
2021). Open question: are handled objects a good index for activity
context?

Changes from day to day: We don't know how much overlap there is from
day to day. While the exact objects may change, it's likely that they'd
follow a similar right-skewed distribution since we see this for most
kids in our sample and across mamy measures of children's input,
including visual (Clerkin, Hart, Rehg, Yu, \& Smith, 2017; Long,
Kachergis, Bhatt, \& Frank, 2021) and linguistic (Montag, Jones, \&
Smith, 2018).

Age: The broad composition of handled objects was largely stable across
age (consistent with Long, Kachergis, Bhatt, \& Frank, 2021 for visually
present categories) but few categories here and also the possibility
that individual types may change. More here about manual dexterity and
possibly attention affecting object handling bout durations, which we
don't quantify here, but the transitions per hour analysis is a
first-pass way of (hopefully) getting at something similar

\hypertarget{consequences-for-learning}{%
\subsection{Consequences for learning}\label{consequences-for-learning}}

Zipfian distributions can be helpful for learning (e.g., Carvalho, Chen,
\& Yu, 2019). Overlap between kids can get us to start thinking about
which object names and object-relevant words and learned earlier. But
important to note that there's less overlap between kids (within sites)
than we see for US context (e.g., Herzberg, Fletcher, Schatz, \&
Tamis-LeMonda, 2021), possibly owing to cultural differences and
sampling strategies (e.g., two-hour videos vs.~daylong photos). Another
point is that while there may be less overlap between kids, there's
likely more overlap between kids and adults (fewer child-specific items)

Notes for near the end: Future plans to link to daylong audio
recordings. We can speculate about children's learning now that we have
some understanding of the distribution of object handling and the
identities of commonly handled objects. However, without knowing how
often children are also hearing \emph{talk} about the objects they're
handling, we can't fully address the word learning piece.
