\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The artifacts of everyday life reflect our routines, aspirations,
relationships, and more. In particular, the objects that we regularly
pick up and handle---a coffee cup, a laptop, a baby bottle---offer a
window into the physical, social, and cultural contexts that shape our
understanding of the world. In this paper, we take a glimpse into
everyday life at its beginnings by exploring children's at-home object
handling from early infancy until age four. We contextualize our study
with respect to the effects of object-centric interaction on word
learning, though we note that different analyses of these same data
could shed new light on other types of social learning as well as motor
development (see Herzberg, Fletcher, Schatz, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2021 on
the latter point).

\hypertarget{object-handling-and-word-learning}{%
\subsection{Object handling and word
learning}\label{object-handling-and-word-learning}}

For young learners, objects---along with their associated activities and
surrounding language---form a critical source of input for word
learning. Hands (and what they are handling) can be reliable indicators
of what someone is doing and talking about during object play ,
facilitating children's ability to map word forms onto their meanings in
and across real-time interaction (e.g., Yu \& Smith, 2013; Yurovsky,
Smith, \& Yu, 2013). Present, attended-to objects also influence the
babble of children who have acquired stable consonants (Laing \&
Bergelson, 2020). Further, caregivers' tendency to use nouns referring
to objects in the here-and-now positively predicts their children's
early word comprehension (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017).

How frequently do children engage in object-centric interactions? First,
hands---others' and their own---are in good supply in young children's
view of the world, especially after early infancy (Fausey, Jayaraman, \&
Smith, 2016; Jayaraman, Fausey, \& Smith, 2017; Long, Kachergis,
Agrawal, \& Frank, 2020), topping out at visible presence \(\sim\) 30\%
of the time. Infants' own object handling is also relatively frequent:
Herzberg and colleagues (2021) find that US infants handle objects
\(\sim\) 60\% of the time during at-home play, Yu and colleagues (2013)
find \(\sim\) 70\% when including joint handling with adults in US
in-lab object play, and Casillas \& Elliott (2021) find \(\sim\) 15 and
17\% object handling in daylong photo streams in a Papuan and a Mayan
community, respectively. Note, however, that \emph{labeling} of
object-relevant features (e.g., names and associated concepts) is the
critical second ingredient for word learning, which may only occur
during a small subset of total object handling time. Additionally, the
likelihood of talk about objects that are being handled in the here and
now---a flagship feature of contingent caregiver talk (e.g., McGillion
et al., 2013)---fluctuates across high and low activity periods of
interaction (Bergelson, Amatuni, Dailey, Koorathota, \& Tor, 2019).

Overall, while prior work makes a strong case for the impact of
children's object-centric interactions on their word learning, the
findings: (a) are limited to a culturally narrow sample of populations,
(b) have tended to rely on short recordings that limit the scope of
object-centered interactions analyzed, and (c) have rarely examined in
detail the distributions of individual objects that children typically
interact with at home (exceptions include Bergelson, Amatuni, Dailey,
Koorathota, \& Tor, 2019; Casillas \& Elliott, 2021; Herzberg, Fletcher,
Schatz, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2021).

\hypertarget{object-handling-across-age-and-culture}{%
\subsection{Object handling across age and
culture}\label{object-handling-across-age-and-culture}}

Children's object handling input changes enormously across the first few
years due to both maturational constraints and culture-specific
caregiving practices. In early infancy, children have little ability to
hold things or to control their posture, primarily experiencing objects
through what others bring near to them. Faces, rather than objects, may
make up a much greater proportion of their social input early on
(Fausey, Jayaraman, \& Smith, 2016; Jayaraman, Fausey, \& Smith, 2017;
but see also Long, Kachergis, Agrawal, \& Frank, 2020). However, later
gains in manual dexterity and gross motor skill (e.g., sitting,
crawling, walking) increasingly widen children's ability to seek, reach,
and grab a diversity of objects in their environment. Increasing motor
development not only gives children greater control over what objects
handle but also how they elicit social information relating to objects
and for how long object-centered interactions last (Adolph, Karasik, \&
Tamis-LeMonda, 2010; Gaskins, 2000; Herzberg, Fletcher, Schatz, \&
Tamis-LeMonda, 2021; Kretch, Franchak, \& Adolph, 2014; Sanchez, Long,
Kraus, \& Frank, 2018).

Early access to objects is also shaped by culture-specific practices for
carrying children, keeping them safe and warm, and scaffolding the
development of locally valued capacities (e.g., word learning in many US
families, walking in Kenyan Kipsigis families: Super, 1976; see Adolph,
Karasik, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2010, for an overview). The array of objects
available to children will also vary in type and prevalence
cross-culturally. Objects spread via globalization (e.g., plastic bags)
and objects with a basic functional role that has arisen similarly
across many groups (e.g., spoon-like things for eating) are likely to
appear in widely, while other objects remain specific to people and
places (e.g., the gourd and bombilla for drinking mate in much of South
America, stemming from Indigenous Guaraní and Tupí tradition). Take, for
example, middle-class US family homes, which have been noted for their
large quantities of possessions (``clutter''), much of which is designed
specifically for children (e.g., toys and books, Arnold, Graesch, Ochs,
\& Ragazzini, 2012). We might infer, based on this distribution, that
much of what children do and talk about at home is tailored to what
particularly interests them. Thus, children's worlds, in this sense,
look very different from their caregivers'. Recent work by Herzberg and
colleagues (2021) underscores this point with infancy data; 13- to
23-month-olds spent nearly 70\% of their time in object play with toys
or a mix of toys and non-toys, with \(\sim\) 100\% of infants playing
with children's books and stuffed animals, and a total of 32 toy types
appearing in \(\ge\) 25\% of infants' play. Non-toy play was also
common, but still appeared to predominantly include infant-specific
objects (e.g., sippy cups, baby spoons, high chairs, pacifiers). We
would expect many of these items to be rare in other parts of the world,
with much greater overlap between objects for infants and objects for
adults (e.g., Karasik, Schneider, Kuchirko, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2018).

\hypertarget{the-current-study}{%
\subsection{The current study}\label{the-current-study}}

Using daylong photo streams from child-worn cameras, we analyze object
handling by children under age four in two rural, small-scale
subsistence farming communities from opposite sides of the globe: Rossel
Island (``Rossel''; Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea) and Tenejapa
(``Tseltal''; Chiapas, Mexico). While these communities are comparable
in many ways (e.g., rural, swidden horticulturalist, housed in
multi-generation family complexes), prior work has established
substantial differences in the organization of young children's daily
lives, child carrying practices, and each community's level of market
integration (e.g., the greater availability of synthetic materials in
Tenejapa), leading us to expect differences in what children handle
across the day and early lifespan (Brown \& Casillas, 2021; Casillas,
Brown, \& Levinson, 2020, 2021; Casillas \& Elliott, 2021). We first
establish how often children handle objects from different categories
(e.g., food vs.~tools), both by the total amount of handling and by
number of unique objects per hour in each category across sites. We
explore the top individual objects in each site and how overlap exists
between sites. Finally, we investigate how the rate and characteristics
of object handling change with developmental age, as predicted in prior
work (Casillas \& Elliott, 2021).

Annotation is ongoing (see Method), but preliminary findings reveal
relative consistency in the broad composition of objects handled by
children both between sites and across age, with a few important
exceptions: a greater diversity of synthetic objects per hour for
Tseltal children (e.g., relating to greater market integration), more
time spent with immovable objects for Rossel children (e.g., relating to
socializing time on/near household verandas), and a greater diversity of
held objects with developmental age. We discuss open questions and
potential implications of these findings for early word learning.

\hypertarget{corpus}{%
\subsection{Corpus}\label{corpus}}

Daylong photo streams consisted of images captured every 15 (Rossel) to
30 (Tseltal) seconds over the course of, typically, 8 (Rossel) to 9
(Tseltal) waking hours at home. Children wore a recording vest equipped
with a camera (Narrative Clip 1) and miniature fisheye lens (Photojojo
Super Fisheye) that provided a 180\(\text{\textdegree}\) view of the
environment. For younger infants who were not yet walking, the camera
was instead worn by the primary caregiver. Previously, 83 daylong photo
streams (113668 photos) had been comprehensively manually annotated for
the presence or absence of child object handling (Casillas \& Elliott,
2021); we further annotate and analyze the subset of 10772 with object
handling in the present study.

We included one daylong photo stream from each of 60 children (Rossel:
28, Tseltal: 32), ranging in age from 0 to 48 months
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 21.6,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 23.1). The amount of object
handling and thus the number of photos annotated varied across children,
ranging from 1 to 591 (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 182.4,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 176.7).

\hypertarget{manual-annotation}{%
\subsection{Manual annotation}\label{manual-annotation}}

We annotated photos with IMCO (version 2.0, Casey, Fisher, Tice, \&
Casillas, 2022), an open-source Python application adapted for efficient
coding of photo streams. Annotators provided labels for the handled
object(s) present in each photo (e.g., ``twig'') and selected among
predefined categories to characterize each type of object (e.g.,
``natural object'') present. Categories included food, tools, toys,
immovable objects (e.g., furniture and housing structures), natural
objects, and miscellaneous synthetic objects (see Figure 1 for example
images and Table \ref{tab:top-objects} for example objects from each
category).

\hypertarget{data-preparation-and-reliability}{%
\subsection{Data preparation and
reliability}\label{data-preparation-and-reliability}}

Images were excluded if they were too dark, bright, blurry, or covered
for annotators to identify handled objects (71 images, 0.7\% of the data
set), if annotators were otherwise unsure about what objects were being
handled (31, or 0.3\%), or if there was no handled object (18, or
0.2\%). To avoid unnecessary data loss, all excluded photos were checked
by at least one other annotator and re-included for analysis if objects
were identifiable. In total, 10759 images were deemed usable by
annotators (5106 for Rossel, 5653 for Tseltal).

XX\% of photo streams were double coded. Reliability annotations were
equally spread across sites and ages and included a total of XXXX
images. At the category level, annotators agreed on XX.X\% of decisions
(Rossel: XX.X\%, Tseltal: XX.X\%). At the object label level, annotators
agreed on XX.X\% of decisions (Rossel: XX.X\%, Tseltal: XX.X\%).

statistics}\label{overall-frequency-statistics}}

Children handled an average of 24.93 unique objects per day (median =
22.5, \emph{SD} = 16.36, range = 1--67), with no significant differences
across sites (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 23.21,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 26.44, \emph{W} = 405, \emph{p}
= 0.529). The distribution of handled objects was highly right-skewed
within and across children. Each child's distribution was skewed such
that a small group of objects were handled in a majority of their
images, with a long tail of other objects that were handled for only
short periods of time (Figure 2). Across children, common objects
followed a similar Zipfian distribution; some objects were handled by
many children, but most objects were only handled by 1-2 children in
each site (Rossel: 63.82\%, Tseltal: 68.55\%).

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Comparing across sites, 28.87\% of objects were present in both
communities, and several shared objects were among the most frequently
handled by children in both sites. In fact, among the top 25 most common
objects, 10 were shared across sites (Figure 3). Of note, the study
camera was the object handled by the most children in both sides
(Rossel: 57.1\%, Tseltal: 90.6\% of children). The camera and other
study-related objects (i.e., vest and privacy cover for the camera),
were retained in our analyses; however, inclusion of these items did not
qualitatively change any of the reported results.

\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

The frequency of object categories was similarly divided across sites
(Figure 4A). The top objects for each category are shown in Table 1.
Children primarily handled miscellaneous synthetic objects (e.g., rope,
guitar, shirt, etc.; \emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 33.47\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 37.96\% of handling) and food
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 28.99\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 32.52\% of handling). For 46 of
60 children, their top category was either synthetic objects or food.
Two-tailed Wilcoxon tests revealed only one marginal category-level
difference between sites: children's handling of large or immovable
objects (e.g., veranda, ladder, chair, etc.), where Rossel children
handled these objects more frequently than Tseltal children
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 7.17\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 3.36\%, adjusted \emph{p} =
0.093, \emph{p}s for all other categories \textgreater{} 0.05), but
these objects were still the least frequently handled in both sites.

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

During any given hour, children handled 6.16 objects from 3.08 different
categories, on average (median = 5 objects, \emph{SD} = 4.63, range =
1--28). A linear mixed-effects model with fixed effects of site, each of
the six object categories, and their interaction showed a significant
main effect of the synthetic object category (\(\beta\) = 0.98,
\emph{SE} = 0.21, \emph{t} = 4.69, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001) as well
as an interaction between site and the synthetic object category
(\(\beta\) = 0.73, \emph{SE} = 0.28, \emph{t} = 2.63, \emph{p} = 0.009)
such that children handled more unique synthetic objects per hour than
any other object category, and this effect was stronger for Tseltal
children than for Rossel children (\emph{p}s \textgreater{} 0.05 for all
other main effects and interaction terms; Figure 4B).

\hypertarget{age-effects}{%
\subsection{Age effects}\label{age-effects}}

Children's overall rate of object handling increased significantly with
age (Figure 5A). That is, older children handled more unique objects per
hour (\(\beta\) = 0.11, \emph{SE} = 0.04, \emph{t} = 2.59, \emph{p} =
0.012). Additionally, with increasing age, children handled more objects
from different categories per hour (Figure 5B; \(\beta\) = 0.03,
\emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = 2.73, \emph{p} = 0.008). These effects were
consistent across sites; we found no main effects of site or
interactions between site and age (all \emph{p}s \textgreater{} 0.05).

To further explore developmental changes in the characteristics of
children's object handling, we measured transitions between different
objects and different object categories. We modeled the relative number
of transitions per hour (i.e., number of transitions divided by the
number of possible objects or categories for the hour) as a function of
age and site, plus their interaction. With increasing age, children made
marginally more transitions between objects (Figure 5C; \(\beta\) =
0.01, \emph{SE} = 0, \emph{t} = 1.91, \emph{p} = 0.061) and signifcantly
more transitions between object categories (Figure 5D; \(\beta\) = 0.03,
\emph{SE} = 0.01, \emph{t} = 2.25, \emph{p} = 0.028) per hour.
