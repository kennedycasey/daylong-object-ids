Across the entire waking day, children handled an average of 21.16
unique objects (median = 20, \emph{SD} = 15.2, range = 1--59), with no
significant differences across sites
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 18.93,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 23.24, \emph{W} = 350, \emph{p}
= 0.501). Only 20.83\% of objects were present in both communities, but
several of these shared objects were among the most frequently handled
by children in both sites. In fact, among the top 25 most common
objects, 11 were shared across sites.

During any given hour, children handled 5.26 objects, on average (median
= 4.5, \emph{SD} = 3.92, range = 1--18).

The frequency of object categories was similarly divided across sites
(Figure 1a). Children primarily handled miscellaneous synthetic objects
(e.g., rope, guitar, shirt, etc.; \emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}}
= 32.01\% of handling, \emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 37.5\%)
and food (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 28.58\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 36.21\%). For 45 of 56
children, their top category was either synthetic objects or food.
Two-tailed Wilcoxon tests revealed that the only significant difference
between sites was seen in children's handling of large or immovable
objects (e.g., veranda, ladder, railing, etc.), where Rossel children
handled these objects more frequently than Tseltal children
(\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Rossel}} = 7.73\%,
\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{Tseltal}} = 3.31\%, adjusted \emph{p} =
0.038, \emph{p}s for all other categories \textgreater{} 0.05).
